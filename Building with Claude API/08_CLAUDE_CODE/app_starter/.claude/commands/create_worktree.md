# Create Worktree

Your task is to create a new worktree named `$ARGUMENTS` in the `.trees/$ARGUMENTS` folder. Follow these steps:

1. Check if an existing folder in the `.trees` folder with the name `feature_a` already exists. If it does, stop here and tell the user the worktree already exists.
2. Create a new git worktree in the `.trees` folder with the name `feature_a`.
3. Symlink the `.venv` folder into the worktree directory.
4. Launch a new VSCode editor instance in that directory by running the `code` command.
